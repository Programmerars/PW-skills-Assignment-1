    "This is in contrast to statically-typed languages where variables are assigned a fixed data type at \n",
    "the time of declaration and cannot be changed thereafter. \n",

    "x = 10  # x is assigned an integer value\n",

Next, we assign a string value \"Hello\" to the same variable x and print its value, which is now \"Hello\". Finally, we assign a list value [1, 2, 3] to the same variable x and print its value, which is now [1, 2, 3].\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the same variable x is being assigned values of different data types (integer, string, and list) during runtime, and Python allows this dynamic change of variable types without any explicit type declarations. This flexibility makes Python a dynamically-typed language, allowing variables to change their data type during runtime based on the value assigned to them. However, it also requires careful handling of variable types and can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior if not managed properly."
